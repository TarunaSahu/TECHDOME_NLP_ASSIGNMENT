<h1> Sentiment Analysis on Given Dataset </h1>
<div>
  <h3>Assignment Objectives:</h3> 
  In this assignment, you will be required to build a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a critical component in many AI applications, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and more. Your task is to create a sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

<h3>DATASET: </h3>
  The dataset consists of three columns: Serial Number (S No.), Comments, and Labels. Each row in the dataset represents a unique observation or comment along with its corresponding label. Here is a sample of the dataset:
  
1.	Serial Number (S No.): This column contains a unique identifier assigned to each comment, serving as a sequential reference. 
2.	Comments: The Comments column contains textual data representing various statements or remarks. Each row corresponds to a specific comment. 
3.	Labels: The Labels column assigns a label to each comment, indicating a binary classification (in this case, "N" or "P"). For example, "N" might signify a negative sentiment, while "P" could represent a positive sentiment.
 
This dataset appears to be designed for sentiment analysis or a similar natural language processing (NLP) task. The Comments column contains the text data that is to be analyzed, and the Labels column indicates the sentiment polarity or classification.
